""" calcHist(images, channels, mask, histSize, ranges, accumulate)
This function takes the following arguments:
images: This is a NumPy array of image pixels. If you have only
one image, just wrap the NumPy variable within a pair of square
brackets, e.g., [image].
channels: This is an array of indexes of channels we want to
calculate the histogram for. This will be [0] for grayscale images
and [0,1,2] for RGB color images.
mask: This is an optional argument. If you do not supply a mask,
the histogram will be calculated for all the pixels in the image or
images. If you supply a mask, the histogram will be calculated for
the masked pixels only.
histSize: This is the number of bins. If we pass this value as
[64,64,64], this means that each channel will have 64 bins. The bin
size may be different for different channels.
ranges: This is the range of pixel values, which is normally [0,255]
for grayscale and RGB color images. This value may be different in
other color schemes, but for now, letâ€™s stick to RGB only.
accumulate: This is the accumulation flag. If it is set, the histogram
is not cleared in the beginning when it is allocated. This feature
enables you to compute a single histogram from several sets of
arrays or to update the histogram in time. The default value is None. """
