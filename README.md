## Techniques of Image processing
- Resizing
11. Cropping: Crop the image to get only the face of the lena
- Image Arithematic 
12. Addition of two Images
13. Substraction of two Images
- Bitwise Operation
14. Bitwise Operation
- Masking.
15. Masking Using Bitwise AND Operation
-Splitting and Merginig channel
16. Splitting channel 
17. Merging of all channel
- Noise reduction using smoothing and blurring
18. Smoothing/Blurring by Mean Filtering or Averaging
19. Smoothing Using the Gaussian Technique

Gaussian filtering is one of the most effective blurring techniques in image processing.
blurring technique gives a more natural smoothing result compared to the averaging technique. 
-- The image represented by the NumPy array.
–– The k×k matrix as the kernel height and width.
–– sigmaX and sigmaY is a standard deviation in the X and Y directions.

20. Median Blurring

The previous three blurring techniques yield blurred images with the side effect that we lose the edges in the image.To blur an image while preserving the edges, we use bilateral
blurring, which is an enhancement over Gaussian blurring.

21. Bilateral blurring
